## Tips and Tricks:
- Don't try to take on more than one enemy at once; you're not superman
- For larger enemies, aim for the hands
- All enemies are undead, that means:
		* You take poison damage just from being near them
		* Sometimes dead enemies won't fall over dead immediately: some may still flail about.
- Some obstacles are illusionary, you can walk right through them!
- you can swing while moving towards an enemy to avoid being vulnerable during your wind-up(damage is calculated at the end of the swing)
